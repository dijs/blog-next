Webpack, Babel, React, Redux... can't get enough of them.\n\nBut when you are staring at a blank editor and need to code something as quickly as possible, getting the initial environment up usually can take longer than coding actual application. With the time futzing with accidental typos in config files, creating the directory structure, finding and downloading dependencies, etc. You could have already had a good wireframe with basic functionality coded.\n\nThis is why I created a few application starters.\n\nBabel: https://github.com/dijs/babel-starter\n\nReact: https://github.com/dijs/react-starter\n\nRedux: https://github.com/dijs/redux-starter\n\nI hope these are useful.\n","slug":"starters","index":24,"path":"/post/starters"},"__N_SSG":true}
