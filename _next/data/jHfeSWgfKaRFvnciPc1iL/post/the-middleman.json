I was required to push to production for each change since our development servers are locked down and not visible to Google.\r\n\r\nIn order to quickly make changes and test them I needed another development environment visible to Google with a clone of the website I was working on.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to proxy the website through a small Node proxy server and modify the response. This kinda worked, but I ran in to too many brick walls...\r\n\r\nI needed more control.\r\n\r\nWhy not just mirror the response?\r\n\r\nWhat I ended up with was a application that would cache a HTTP response for a given URL and modify the page by adding CSS and Javascript to the response. If there are any dependencies, the server will proxy them through with a little Express magic.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [source](https://github.com/dijs/middleman).\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\n- Add a edit page to accompany the view, currently you just make another middleman page\r\n- Add more modification options\r\n","slug":"the-middleman","index":30,"path":"/post/the-middleman"},"__N_SSG":true}
