It has been a challenge and a great learning experience.\n\nI will devote this post to sharing my journey through coding my last entry. But if anyone is interested, here are the links to my past entries.\n\n- [https://js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1848](https://js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1848)\n- [https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2136](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2136)\n- *I missed 2016 for some reason, I don't remember why*\n- [https://js1k.com/2017-magic/demo/2693](https://js1k.com/2017-magic/demo/2693)\n- [https://js1k.com/2018-coins/demo/3103](https://js1k.com/2018-coins/demo/3103)\n\nAnd my latest, [https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4099](https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4099)\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://jsfiddle.net/dijs/4a3z9pvu/5/embedded/result\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n\nI split this project into sections, to make sure each step made sense and worked properly.\n\nThe last thing you want to do is jump right into rolling your own neural network... please don't do that.\n\nMy goals were:\n\n1. Figure how to render a stylish 'X' to the screen\n2. Scale down and transform the image data to something a neural network can use for input\n3. Use an already built library to build first neural network (I used [brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js))\n4. Simplify everything as much as possible\n5. Replace NN library with simplified functions which implement forward/backward propagation\n6. Add style\n\n","slug":"retro-neural-network","index":10,"path":"/post/retro-neural-network"},"__N_SSG":true}
