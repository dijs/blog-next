I decided to mess around with some simple 2d tree generation. By using a simple tree structure and a bit of geometry and calculated the size, position, and direction of the limbs. The leaves are just connected to the end of limbs.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://jsfiddle.net/dijs/cxv3L5yw/embedded/result,js\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAfter completing the 2d version. I decided with a bit of more geometry, I could create a similar 3d version. Of course, I had to brush up on some 3d math, but the end result was worth it.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://jsfiddle.net/dijs/4a0oah5r/embedded/result,js\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nRefresh to see different trees!\r\n\r\nNow that the 3d math is figured out, I can try to make it look more realistic in the future.\r\n","slug":"trees","index":28,"path":"/post/trees"},"__N_SSG":true}
