Although it is powerful and _flexible_, it has a bit of a learning curve.\n\nThis tool gives you the ability to visually create a flexbox layout and learn some of the common rules relating to `flexbox`.\n\nCheck out the [tool](https://dijs.github.io/flex/)\n\nThere are a few built-in example layouts to use, or you can start from scratch.\n\nYou can configure the **container** and **item** properties separately and learn what each property is for by focusing on it.\n\nWhen your layout is finished, you can copy the generated source code to your own project code and fine tune as you like.\n","slug":"flex","index":8,"path":"/post/flex"},"__N_SSG":true}
