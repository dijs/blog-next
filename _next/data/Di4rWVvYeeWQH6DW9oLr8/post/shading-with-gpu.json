I started with lots of over complicated math and rendering methods. But after trial and error and some creativity, I ended up with this process:\n\n**For each pixel in the image**\n1. Compute the luminance\n2. Threshold color based on dynamic number of spaces\n3. Exponentially expand value to create the illusion of more or less shading\n4. Use dynamic function to decide whether or not the pixel is a part of a shade line\n\n","slug":"shading-with-gpu","index":12,"path":"/post/shading-with-gpu"},"__N_SSG":true}
