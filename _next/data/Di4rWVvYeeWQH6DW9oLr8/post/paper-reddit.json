Their current user experience is **annoying** and their interface is frankly **inefficient**.\n\nTake a look at the examples below:\n\n<img src=\"/reddit-mobile.png\" width=\"300\">\n<img src=\"/reddit-sub.png\" width=\"300\">\n\n### In mobile\n\n**Every** time you are trying to browse on your phone, they harass you about the app. Learn to use a freaking cookie to save the user's preference reddit...\n\nI will give them a little credit for their mobile post design. It is simple and functional.\n\nYet, as soon as desire to go any further, I reach a roadblock.\n\nWhat kind of gatekeeping is this reddit? Didn't I already express my desire to stay in the browser. This is unacceptable.\n\n### In desktop\n\nNow this is just unbelievable to me. How many posts are visible on a full screen desktop reddit user interface. Let's count them together... 1... Oh, your done already? Yep, that's right. Explain to me how only 1 post fits on a full desktop web app?\n\n<img src=\"/reddit-desktop.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n### Paper Reddit\n\nDue to my frustration with reddit's mobile web application, I just created my own. Took just a few days to make something useable. I now use it everyday instead of their web app.\n\nIt's a dead simple reader for the casual reddit user. If you are looking for the full featured version, go find a native reddit app.\n\nPlease check out [Paper Reddit](https://reddit-weld.vercel.app/r/popular)!\n","slug":"paper-reddit","index":2,"path":"/post/paper-reddit"},"__N_SSG":true}
