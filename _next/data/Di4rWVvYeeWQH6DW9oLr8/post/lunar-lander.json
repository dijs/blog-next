A favorite of mine is the classic lunar lander. Space, physics, thrusters, danger level 9000!\n\nI kept it quite simple and focused on getting the movement of the ship correct rather than focusing on the landscape.\n\nDemo is [here](https://dijs.github.io/lunar-lander/)\n\nSource is [here](https://github.com/dijs/lunar-lander)\n\nOne interesting part of my code renders the stars without ever storing their position in a data structure. Their presence and location is determined by a custom seeded random function.\n\nI have plans on using this game as a platform for teaching a machine learning agent to pilot the landing craft using reinforcement learning. But, finding a way to score each decsion the pilot makes is a tough problem.\n","slug":"lunar-lander","index":6,"path":"/post/lunar-lander"},"__N_SSG":true}
