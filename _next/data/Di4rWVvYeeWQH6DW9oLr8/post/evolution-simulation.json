The idea was to simulate natural selection of traits: speed, size, and sense.\n\nSpeed controls the rate at which a creature can move around and search for food.\n\nSize controls if they can eat other creatures.\n\nSense controls the radius of the area the creature can _sense_ around them.\n\nMovement cost is calculated as size<sup>3</sup> + speed<sup>2</sup> + sense\n\nAt each step, if a creature has enough energy, they move around and search for food in order to survive. If they sense a creature less than 30% of their size, they can eat them instead.\n\nIf they found more at least one piece of food, they survive the day.\n\nIf they found more than one piece of food, they generate another creature with traits similar to theirs.\n\nThe simulation ends when no creature survives the day.\n\n## Demo\n\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px;\" src=\"https://dijs.github.io/evolution-sim/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nSource is [here](https://github.com/dijs/evolution-sim)\n","slug":"evolution-simulation","index":9,"path":"/post/evolution-simulation"},"__N_SSG":true}
