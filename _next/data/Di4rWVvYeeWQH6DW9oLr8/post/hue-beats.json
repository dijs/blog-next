Growing up, I adored all the music visualization programs we had. Very cool stuff.\n\nAfter recently using the Hue lights to code a custom alarm system, I had the idea to create my own music visualization program. This is my first time, so...\n\nI learned quickly, decoding audio data is tough. Or maybe I am missing something.\n\nI could not find an audio library for node that just worked. One had a binary dependency that wouldn't compile on my OSX. I ended up just using a node version of the WebAudio API, which is really cool. But still, I am an audio processing n00b.\n\nAnyways, I got something working even though the timing is a little off.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/videos/hue-beats-480.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n","slug":"hue-beats","index":23,"path":"/post/hue-beats"},"__N_SSG":true}
