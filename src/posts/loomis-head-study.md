I recently watched this video and was amazed at how easy it became to sketch out a head shape with all the feature points.

After practing a bit, I got the idea of "automating" the rules of the Loomis Head System.

Here is what I came up with. It is a small subset of what you can prototype with the system, but for a few poses it works quite well.
