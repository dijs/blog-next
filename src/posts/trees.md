I am a sucker for world generation techniques. I decided to mess around with some simple 2d tree generation. By using a simple tree structure and a bit of geometry and calculated the size, position, and direction of the limbs. The leaves are just connected to the end of limbs.

After completing the 2d version. I decided with a bit of more geometry, I could create a similar 3d version. Of course, I had to brush up on some 3d math, but the end result was worth it.

Refresh to see different trees!

Now that the 3d math is figured out, I can try to make it look more realistic in the future.
