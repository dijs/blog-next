Learning how to handle money is an important part of growing up. The sooner we can learn and apply good financial skills, the easier the rest of our financial life will be.

I have been using Mint for over five years now. It is now core part of our budgeting and financial workflow.

Recently came across [madFIentist](http://www.madfientist.com/) and was blown away by the fact that he not only writes great financial blog posts, but also builds tools to go along with them. That is something I can get behind.

I have been looking to use the data Mint accumulated for me and use my coding skills to reduce that data into something more useful.

After reading about and using his FI [spreadsheet](http://www.madfientist.com/financial-independence-spreadsheet/), I decided I could use similar formulas to calculate my financial independence data for me without ever having to update the spreadsheet.

My application reads, parses, transforms and reduces your Mint transactions into Financial Independence information.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/dijs/mint-fi) and let me know what you think.

*I would love to add more features and create a UI for it, but I just wanted to get something out for now.*
