Ever been under pressure to throw up a react/redux application in 20 minutes?

Good luck!

I love the modern technology stack we have today for building isomorphic javascript applications. Webpack, Babel, React, Redux... can't get enough of them.

But when you are staring at a blank editor and need to code something as quickly as possible, getting the initial environment up usually can take longer than coding actual application. With the time futzing with accidental typos in config files, creating the directory structure, finding and downloading dependencies, etc. You could have already had a good wireframe with basic functionality coded.

This is why I created a few application starters.

Babel: https://github.com/dijs/babel-starter

React: https://github.com/dijs/react-starter

Redux: https://github.com/dijs/redux-starter

I hope these are useful.
