    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: July 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to SafeCheck. By using the SafeCheck mobile application, you agree
      to the following terms and conditions:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
      SafeCheck monitors device movement and battery status to notify emergency
      contacts if certain safety thresholds are met. It is designed to offer
      peace of mind for caregivers, families, and individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use the app responsibly and only for its intended
      safety-related purposes. You must not use the app to harass, monitor, or
      otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for providing accurate emergency contact information
      and configuring alert thresholds appropriately.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Guarantee of Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      While SafeCheck will attempt to send alerts via email, SMS, or push
      notifications, we cannot guarantee delivery due to third-party service
      limitations.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
    <p>
      SafeCheck offers subscription tiers for expanded alert features. Payment
      is managed through the App Store, and all billing and cancellations must
      be handled via your Apple ID account.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      SafeCheck is provided as-is and we are not liable for any damages
      resulting from missed alerts, incorrect contact details, or misuse of the
      app.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these terms occasionally. Continued use of the app means you
      accept any changes.

      Emergency contact data is stored locally and/or securely on our servers
