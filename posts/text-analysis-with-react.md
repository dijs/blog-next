Okay. I created a sample React app which has a live text analyzer.

I think building the components within Javascript is cool, and would be up for doing that more.

Communication between components is crazy messy though. Maybe I am not doing it correctly, but even the documentation was confusing. In order to bind two components to listen and use a data element, I had to use vanilla Javascript event listeners and dispatchersâ€¦ Really?

### Bottom line

- Building app structure/markup in Javascript is a great idea.
- Breaking down your app into simple testable components is wonderful
- Component communication is down right confusing
