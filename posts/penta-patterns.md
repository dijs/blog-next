## The Background

I started playing guitar when I was around 13 years old. My default learning style was self taught, relying heavily on YouTube tutorials and online resources. While trying to piece together information from various sources to understand scales, chords, and riffs from my favorite songs, I found myself struggling to visualize and memorize notes across the fretboard. I felt like I was memorizing tabs without truly understanding the underlying patterns.

I essentially stagnated in my playing for a long time. I would feel somewhat comfortable playing in a few keys, but I couldn't easily transpose or improvise. And when I tried to improvise, I often would stray off key and totally throw me off.

## Discovering something new

After going to a local concert and meeting the brilliant guitarist, the stars aligned and I was able to get a few lessons from him. My first ever guitar lessons, after more than a decade of playing! He introduced me to the concept of pentatonic scale patterns across the fretboard. This was a game-changer for me. Suddenly, I could see how the notes connected, and I started to understand how to navigate the fretboard more intuitively.

## More confidence, more freedom

With this new understanding, I began to experiment more with improvisation. I found that by knowing the pentatonic patterns, I could easily stay within the key and create solos that sounded coherent and musical. This newfound confidence allowed me to explore different genres and styles, as I was no longer confined to memorized tabs. I now jam along to the wonderful Youtube channel [Quist](https://www.youtube.com/nowyoushred) and even try to improvise over the random music I hear while my wife is scrolling through TikTok and Instagram reels.

I encourage any guitarist, whether beginner or experienced, to explore the pentatonic scale patterns. It has truly transformed my playing and opened up a world of musical possibilities.

I create this application to help others learn and visualize these patterns across the fretboard. By practicing with these patterns, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the guitar and enhance your improvisational skills. You can also use the built in chord finder to see how chords are constructed from these scales.
