_TLDR;_

Current mobile reddit sucks, use [Paper Reddit](https://reddit-weld.vercel.app/r/popular) instead.

_Full version:_

I have been becoming more and more aggrevated with Reddit over the last few years. Their current user experience is **annoying** and their interface is frankly **inefficient**.

Take a look at the examples below:

### In mobile

**Every** time you are trying to browse on your phone, they harass you about the app. Learn to use a freaking cookie to save the user's preference reddit...

I will give them a little credit for their mobile post design. It is simple and functional.

Yet, as soon as desire to go any further, I reach a roadblock.

What kind of gatekeeping is this reddit? Didn't I already express my desire to stay in the browser. This is unacceptable.

### In desktop

Now this is just unbelievable to me. How many posts are visible on a full screen desktop reddit user interface. Let's count them together... 1... Oh, your done already? Yep, that's right. Explain to me how only 1 post fits on a full desktop web app?

### Paper Reddit

Due to my frustration with reddit's mobile web application, I just created my own. Took just a few days to make something useable. I now use it everyday instead of their web app.

It's a dead simple reader for the casual reddit user. If you are looking for the full featured version, go find a native reddit app.
