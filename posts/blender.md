## Why

With all the game development I have been doing recently, I have been wanting to make my 3d models for game environments, objects, and characters. Honestly, though, it seemed an impossible task. I see all these realistic models and think how difficult it must be to learn this skill. Indeed, it has been a lot of effort, but much more fun than difficult.

## Learning

I went about learning Blender the same way I would have for a new programming language: Do some initial research and tutorials, then once I have a basic understanding, start doing random projects. With each model I worked on, I learned something new and became more knowledgeable about Blender's features. I started with the now-famous doughnut [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD). It took me a few days to get through that, but I left with a wealth of knowledge and a sense of comfortability in Blender.

## Demos

These are examples of models I have rendered since starting:
