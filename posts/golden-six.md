I recently discovered the "Golden Six" workout routine and found it to be the perfect solution for my gym visits. Deciding on a workout routine can be overwhelming, but the "Golden Six," popularized by Arnold Schwarzenegger, provides a structured and effective approach. Motivated by this, I developed an app to track my progress and maintain motivation. The app guides users through the workout with helpful features.

## Understanding the Workout

The "Golden Six" workout, integral to Arnold Schwarzenegger's early bodybuilding regime, focuses on six fundamental exercises:

- Squats
- Bench Press
- Chin-Ups
- Behind-the-Neck Overhead Press
- Barbell Curls
- Bent Knee Sit-Ups

Chosen for their effectiveness in building a balanced physique, these exercises are ideal for both beginners and seasoned gym-goers. The routine, performed three times a week, involves two sets of 8-12 reps per exercise. It's a straightforward yet comprehensive approach to fitness.

## Application Features

The app enhances the workout experience by providing visuals and detailed descriptions for each exercise, demonstrating proper form and the targeted muscle groups. Users can conveniently mark sets as complete and track their progress without losing data due to screen timeouts or refreshes. Additionally, a built-in timer helps users manage their workout duration, ideal for those with time-specific fitness goals.

This application is more than just a fitness tool; it bridges the gap between classic bodybuilding principles and modern technology convenience. Suitable for fitness enthusiasts and admirers of Arnold Schwarzenegger's training philosophy, this app offers a comprehensive, user-friendly workout experience.

Enjoy the app and happy lifting!
