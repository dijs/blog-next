Make the most of your financial future.","layout":"post","date":"Jul 29, 2021"},"content":"\nDo you feel financially lost? Or unsure?\n\nDo you know how much money you spend every month?\n\nAre you saving any money for retirement?\n\nIf you are unsure about this information or any of these questions are stressful for you, I have a tool for you.\n\n👉 [Check it out](https://budget.vanderdys.design)\n\nAfter years of researching various common financial questions, I have finally combined my wealth of knowledge together into a magical app.\n\nThe app is simple to use:\n\nAdd your income information, expenses, debt, and current account balances.\n\nThen... MAGIC.\n\nThe app instantly calculates how much money you need to save \u0026 how long it will take to save in order to live with your current expenses without working at all.\n\nHow?\n\n\u003e “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it…he who doesn't…pays it.” ― Einstein...probably\n\nBecoming a millionaire is **not** about winning the lottery or require earning large yearly sums of money.\n\nYou can become a millionaire by following these rules:\n\n- Invest money, consistently.\n- If you don't have enough money to invest, spend less.\n- If you cannot spend less, make more money.\n\nSo, let's break those down a bit.\n\n## Invest money, consistently\n\nStart investing **as soon as possible**. If you haven't started yet, start today. This blog post is not about _How to Invest_, although if readers are interested in learning more about that, just leave a comment.\n\nKeeping your savings in an common savings account is useless for growing your wealth. It is not uncommon to make a 120 times larger rate of return by using mutual funds instead.\n\nWhen investing, instead of trying to _time_ the market, just keep contributing a consistent amount of money to your account every time you get paid.\n\n\u003e #### Example:\n\n\u003e George makes $1000/week. He invests $100 every week into a mutual fund making an average of 12%.\n\u003e In a little over 27 years, George has 1 million dollars in his investment account.\n\n## If you don't have enough money to invest, spend less.\n\nHere is where a budget comes into play. If you do don't know how much money in coming in, and how much money is being spent, how will you be able to organize your finances and make a plan to save? The answer is, you wont.\n\nUse the app to list out your expenses by week, monthly, or yearly, whatever makes sense for each. Be sure **not** to confuse debts with expenses. Debt's should fall off after some time, expenses normally will not.\n\nOnce you have your expenses listed out. Do some thinking: \"Can I get rid of any of these expenses?\". You can even remove them just to see how much more you could save each month.\n\nRemember: save now, play later.\n\n## If you cannot spend less, make more money.\n\nYeah... that might sound a bit harsh. But money doesn't grow on trees people.\n\nBetter yourself. Learn a new skill. Always keep a realistic goal!\n\nThe jobs are out there just waiting for you. In almost all cases, they will not fall into your lap. Finding a good paying job require a lot of time and effort!\n\nGood luck on your journey,\n\nI hope the app helps.\n","slug":"budget-app","index":0,"path":"/post/budget-app"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Power of Spreadsheets","blurb":"Let's implement an algorithm","layout":"post","date":"Apr 2, 2021"},"content":"\nThe nice thing about implementing an iterative algorithm in a spreadsheet is you can see every step along the way.\n\nThis provides a clear picture of how the algorithm operates.\n\nTry changing the search key in the spreadsheet below to see how it works!\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: none; width: 100%; height: 550px;\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1crapqGtW-s00yYbskrYbL0pb43Uy1NjplGQROUSUe5E/edit?usp=sharing\u0026single=true\u0026widget=true\u0026headers=false\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","slug":"power-of-spreadsheets","index":1,"path":"/post/power-of-spreadsheets"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Paper Reddit","blurb":"Reddit.

These are my thoughts surrounding the situation.\n\nI have always been a lover of history. I am not exactly sure where it came from. It could have stemmed from a few great teachers I had during my time in the Texas public education system. It could have sprung from watching my stepfather read every single word on every single informational plaque while we visited new places. The seed was planted, and from it grew my desire to learn about the past.\n\nTo learn about and appreciate history is to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. How did humans get to our current state of being? Many of us grow up hearing some form of the famous quote:\n\n\u003e \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e ― George Santayana\n\nHumans can be wonderfully kind. Humans can also be wretchedly cruel. It is between these two mentalities where most humans operate. In my experience, as a child, I learned about different cultures and understood them to be alien species in faraway lands. As I grew, I was blessed to have friends of many different cultural backgrounds. This only deepened my desire to learn more about human cultures and their various histories. Some systems of thought may try to separate and divide people. But the fact is, we are all human. We all suffer. We all love. We, humans, are more similar than different across the world.\n\nIn our digital world, people can lie to build up a false image of themselves. I am sad for these people. To live an honest life may be a difficult road, but it is full of freedom. Where there is openness and honesty, there comes understanding, forgiveness, and eventually trust. Let's be open about our feelings, discuss, and find healthy solutions to our problems.\n\nI don't want to bring up my children in a false world. I believe it is important to see a progression of history, be it full of good and evil. If we cover up and forget the events of the past, we are not only lying to our future generations but also disrespecting those who suffered through these past events. The poor souls who lived and died through times of chaos deserve to be remembered. A life is special and unique. Every single one had and will have a story. Whether or not these stories will be passed on is up to us.\n\nThere is a time and place to share knowledge, and I believe children will give a clear signal when they are ready to learn about certain events. There is no need to force history onto children, they will eventually desire to learn it for themselves. Why? Because humans are curious. Our curiosity must be satisfied.\n\nOur history is important and should be remembered. The more we learn, the more we will grow, and the more we will love. I will conclude with one of my favorite quotes.\n\n\u003e \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e ― Mark Twain\n","slug":"concerning-dr-seuss","index":3,"path":"/post/concerning-dr-seuss"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Oh Node...","layout":"post","date":"Dec 10, 2020","blurb":"Write something here!"},"content":"\nOh Node...\n\nMaybe that was a pun. I didn't intend it to be, but if it makes you smile, there it is.\n\nI am quite pissed off with NodeJS right now.\n\n### Context\n\nA few minutes ago, I opened a web app project from 2 years ago (according to the git commit). I had a quick look at the project structure. It's a NextJS app. Awesome, go me. I used a fresh modern framework with practically no extras. I mean, I added SASS. Forgive me. What would a sane JS developer do? `npm install` and start a built-in development server? That is what I thought too...\n\n💥 BOOM! 💥\n\nBabel and webpack errors oh my. Grrr... How and why would this be the case? I am using Next for goodness sake. Isn't Next supposed to handle this low-level transpilation and compilation for you?\n\nI don't care if I am using a version of Next that is 5 major versions old. At one point it worked just fine. Why would it magically not work now?\n\n### Frustration\n\nI enjoy modern Javascript. But boy have I grown to hate Node. If anything slows down my productivity on almost a daily basis and causes headaches, it's Node.\n\nI would rather have to wait 10 mins for `npm install` to fully download everything my project depends on as long as it works every time.\n\nAnd I am not even touching `package-lock.json`... What a mess. A developer should not have to maintain two separate files that contain information about dependency versions.\n\nI know I am not the only developer with Node issues. But if the problem is this large, the community should be working on a solution right?\n\nYarn was a failure. It tried to do what `npm` does, but better. But that doesn't fix the underlying issues of Node package dependencies.\n\n### Hope\n\nNot sure how everything will shake out in the community. But I have heard good things about [deno](https://deno.land). Let's all hope that `deno` allows us to code with modern Javascript while not having to stress about our dependencies and whether they will work out of the box after two years.\n","slug":"oh-node","index":4,"path":"/post/oh-node"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Dungeon Generator","blurb":"Overlap some rooms, then separate.

I want to play around and see what I like most. Developing games in Godot deserves an entire post or multiple to itself, but this post is about **dungeons**...\n\nEveryone and their brother has a dungeon generator and there are already fancy algorithms which generate them for you.\n\nBut I wanted to learn how they work and wanted something custom. So I made one.\n\nThe dungeons for this particular game are quite simple. There are no complex mazes or paths in between rooms.\n\n_If you just want to play with the generator, just scroll to the bottom._\n\n## The Algorithm\n\nThe general algorithm for this is as follows:\n\n- Generate a number of overlapping rectangles of different sizes (rooms)\n- While a room overlaps another\n  - Move that room one unit in a random direction\n  - If moving the room causes an \"island\" to exist, reverse that movement\n\nBut what is an _island_?\n\nFor this algorithm, an island is simply a room which does not intersect another room. But there is an edge case...\n\nIf you count a corner to corner overlap as an intersection, that may cause issues in your game. So I added a check for a _minimum overlap area_.\n\n## Let's do better.\n\nWith the algorithm above, I was able to generate small 3-5 room dungeons in around 50-100 iterations of the algorithm. But when I tried big dungeons, like 16-24 rooms, it took over a 1000 iterations and multiple seconds to solve!\n\nIn order to make this more efficient, I thought about using a set room velocity instead of always picking a random direction. This worked wonders. I had similar results and much fewer iterations. I was able to crank out a 32 room dungeon in less than a second.\n\n## Enjoy some generated dungeons.\n\n**Reset** makes a bunch of overlapping rooms\n\n**Generate** generates the dungeon all at once\n\n**Tick** generates the dungeon one step at a time\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 400px;\" src=\"https://jsfiddle.net/dijs/196mbuyp/embedded/result\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","slug":"dungeon-generator","index":5,"path":"/post/dungeon-generator"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Lunar Lander","blurb":"The classic moon landing, but WAY easier","layout":"post","date":"Nov 3, 2019"},"content":"\nI have been feeling like making games.

If not and you are a Javascript developer, please go check it out.\n\nWhen developing, I am constantly trying to be as succinct as possible in my coding. I want my code to be readable and straight to the point.\n\nTake this example:\n\n```js\nconst getRebelNames = pilots =\u003e\n  pilots.filter(pilot =\u003e pilot.faction === 'rebel').map(pilot =\u003e pilot.name);\n```\n\nWith modern JS, it is much cleaner than we had before:\n\n```js\nfunction getRebelNames(pilots) {\n  return pilots\n    .filter(function(pilot) {\n      return pilot.faction === 'rebel';\n    })\n    .map(function() {\n      return pilot.name;\n    });\n}\n```\n\nBut, when you read these lines, they don't quite flow as much as I would desire.\n\nMy thoughts when reading\n\n```js\nmap(pilot =\u003e pilot.name);\n```\n\nare as follows...\n\n`map over ... function with pilot argument ... name property of pilot`\n\nI want better than that. In the past, I have written functions just to help with readability.\n\n```js\nconst byName = pilot =\u003e pilot.name;\nmap(byName);\n```\n\nThat is fine, but I feel that this should be built into the language itself.\n\nToday we have Babel, and so I thought I could write a plugin which adds syntax and functionality which would help me write cleaner code.\n\nI was halfway right.\n\nTurns out, adding syntax is not so easy. You can only use what Babel (through Babylon) has deemed worthy, unless you want to fork their library and write your own syntax parser addition. I had never written a Babel plugin, and I wasn't going to open yet another Pandora's box. So, sadly, I had to come up with an alternative solution: _Use valid syntax in another way to achieve my goal_.\n\nI decided to **steal** an operator which is rarely used (at least by me) to be used for another purpose.\n\nWithout further ado,\n\n```js\npilots.map(~name);\n```\n\nThe `~` operator acts as a shortcut to reading a property of the first argument in a call expression. So this code would transpile to:\n\n```js\npilots.map(_uid =\u003e _uid.name);\n```\n\nI wanted a syntax closer to\n\n```js\npilots.map(.name)\n```\n\nBut, alas, this is not possible yet. Maybe in the future Babel will support a way to introduce custom syntax.\n\nCurrently, there is support for basic use cases, but it was not my goal to support ALL use cases. I was just trying to learn how to write Babel plugins.\n\nHere is the example from above using this new feature:\n\n```js\nconst getRebelNames = pilots =\u003e pilots.filter(~faction === 'rebel').map(~name);\n```\n\nIf you are interested in using this plugin, it is available right now!\n\nHere is the npm [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-assume-first-argument)\n\nLastly, a shout out to the helpful links I found for learning:\n\n- [The Handbook](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md)\n- An excellent starting [repo](https://github.com/40x/babel-plugin-runtime-logger) which has easy to use tests\n","slug":"custom-babel-plugin","index":7,"path":"/post/custom-babel-plugin"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Flex","blurb":"A tool for planning out flex layouts","layout":"post","date":"Jun 27, 2019"},"content":"\nFor those of you who have always had difficulty organizing your content with CSS, this tool is for you!\n\nThe not-so-new `flexbox` layout [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) by all modern browsers is quite the step up from the old days of tables or `float` + `margin`.

As modern developers, we can get too focused on what our frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) are doing for us, and we forget what our users are actually being served. With our users in mind, we can continue using our frameworks, but transform what the user receives to significantly improve the performance of the site.\n\nHave you looked at the output HTML for a basic client-side React app?\nIt is the bare minimum for HTML, with some javascript to load the app. This might be fine for apps that are not user facing, Admin UI's, Internal Tools, etc. But if this is an external application which will need to be SEO friendly, this is horrible. We need to give our users **something** on the first page load!\n\nDo you remember the olden days of website programming? A different HTML file for each page where CSS and JS was sprinkled within? Sure, this eventually became a burden to maintain when applications grew large, but the benefit was **there was no magic**! There was not a bunch of different libraries transforming a bunch of independent modules, setting up communication between them, transpiling, prepping them for rendering, minifying and more.\n\nOur end users **do not care** about that.\n\n...\n\nBut developers do.\n\nThat is why these frameworks exist! Because they are incredibly helpful. [They](https://reactjs.org/) allow us to separate business logic from views and to organize our code in a well maintainable manner. [They](https://babeljs.io/) give us brand new ways to use our programming languages. [They](https://webpack.js.org/) compile all our code and resources down into a package which is easy to deploy.\n\nSo, what is my point? Why can't we have both?\n\n**You can.**\n\nI'm not talking about the server-side rendering of these frameworks. Yes, that is cool, but in that scenario the server is having to run, build, render, and serve your application for each request (*with the opportunity to cache of course*).\n\nBut what if we could do better?\n\n**You can.**\n\nWrite your app using a modern framework.

I wanted to build a recognition platform on top of this, but I quickly determined I was in **way** over my head...\n\nNeural networks have come a long way since then.\n\nSince moving into our home, I have been trying to find ways of gathering data. Temperatures inside and outside, moisture levels in the garden, todo list data, camera systems with motion detection, etc. I have been doing this in the hope that one day, I can create a neural networks to help with things around the house.\n\nRecently, I have had a breakthrough in this area.\n\nAfter noticing that I was _accidentally_ storing hundreds of gigabytes of motion detection videos, I realized the treasure this could be!\n\n## Finding the interesting bits\n\nSince I peruse the tech blogs every day, I remembered seeing some new work in the image tagging world. After some searching, I found it again, [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). After building this library, downloading a previously trained model, and learning a bit of python, I was labeling objects in my videos!\n\nAt first, I naively thought there was no way this could work for my use case. Each tag took around 30 seconds to calculate and I was potentially going to have thousands of frames thrown at this thing.\n\nNO. I went a **much** simpler route that has bene working well.\n\n## Only a few frames\n\nI decided there was no reason to analyze entire videos worth of frames. My motion detection was already doing the hard work for me. I decided to break out **ffmpeg** and extract a few frames of the detection video.\n\nThis greatly simplified my problem. Now all I had to do was tag a few images for each detection video.\n\nI quickly wrote a simple python server that accepted an POST request with an image, and used YOLO to spit out a list of labels. Each which had bounding box data... this was getting exciting.\n\n## Tagging\n\nJust for fun, I whipped up a quick react app which allowed me to _swipe_ through all my tagged objects and give them **real** labels.\n\n## Personal Recognition\n\nTo be honest, the labels were nice, but those were not what I was after. I wanted to know when my wife walks through the gate, if my dog is barking at the fence, or if a friend comes over. That was my goal.\n\nI went back to a library I had tried before and failed with. [ConvNetJS](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html) I had remembered he made a demo which could learn to recognize objects from a dataset with 90% accuracy after just a few minutes.\n\nHere is the [demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/cifar10.html).\n\nI now had a large amount of raw training data, and a potential library to use.\n\nI knew my raw data needed to be cleaned up and normalized for it to run through a network. I kept it simple, I **cropped** out the detected boundary of the image then used a **contain** algorithm to resize them to 64x64. In the future I want to also save a horizontal flipped version of the image so I can double my training data.\n\nIt took a fews day to figure out ConvNetJS. At first I was only running the data through once per image and expecting it to work 🤦.\n\nI went back to the demo and realized he was throwing random input images at the network and teaching it the correct label, while minimizing the \"classification loss\". I coded up something very similar, but without the fancy graphs. It was just a terminal app that took all my normalized images and personal labels and trained them randomly over a set amount of iterations.\n\nAfter tweaking the network training configuration a few times, my training normally takes around 30 mins, and performs quite well.\n\nI now get emails throughout the day of **recognized** people, dogs, cars, etc.\n\nStill more work to do, but I am very happy with where it is right now.\n","slug":"homemade-thing-recognizer","index":17,"path":"/post/homemade-thing-recognizer"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Self Learning Game","blurb":"Training a neural network to play a simple shoot-em-up game by trial and error","layout":"post","date":"Aug 29, 2017"},"content":"\nLong have I been trying to make some time to properly use machine learning to\nplay a game.\n\nIn the past, I tried teaching a neural network to play Mario. That did not go very well. [Link](http://richard.vanderdys.blog/posts/stupid-mario.html)\n\nI believe there were too many inputs. I see what I was thinking, I wanted to give the network our entire visual input. But this is not entirely realistic. When we play games, we are not evaluating each pixel of each frame! We are using our incredible eyes to focus on certain parts of the screen, most notably where the player is and what objects are relatively close to him.\n\nSo, Round 2.\n\nI made a simpler game where the goal is not to get hit by missiles.\n\nTake a look:\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 900px;\" src=\"https://dijs.github.io/ai-dodger/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nSo, I wanted to train a network to decide where to move next based on the current player's state.\n\nAfter creating the actual game and playing it a bit, I generalized the code to\naccept an AI player.\n\nI went through 3 different machine learning implementations before I actually got something that worked.\n\nFirst, was a hand coded solution which tried to use a table with all possible\ninputs and outcomes, and each cell was updated as to which action was best in that state. This solution did not seem to work at all, although it would be interesting to try again using what I have learned now.\n\nI instead, tried to use a already built solution for neural networks. I had heard great things about ConvNetJS, so I implemented the [Reinforcement Learning Brain](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html) to be my actor. The result was not much better... At this point, I created the \"Average Reward Over Time\" visualization that you can see on the right of the game. These numbers should be growing as time passes, since the AI is supposed to get smarter. But they were not. So, I scrapped that library.\n\nI went with another [library](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/) that focused only on reinforcement learning. Same author. Since I had already generalized the code, implementing this new library was very straightforward. And almost immediately I saw actual learning. So, after cleaning up the code and putting some lipstick on the game itself, I called it a success.\n\nFinally, an AI player that teaches itself to play a simple game!\n\nFor those who are interested, the training inputs I finalized on were simply an array of binary digits which signified whether there existed enemies relative to the players positions (in a line of sight fashion).

Most of them were a bit too grand scale, so I decided to get a feel for the roomba's hackability with a simple project first. I will create a drivable roomba with sight.\n\nIn order to start creating the robot, I did a lot of research and decided to use a raspberry pi for the \"brain\" of the bot instead of an arduino (which I had used before) because I needed WiFi, more CPU, easy power and serial inputs.\n\nThe pi setup was pretty straightforward. Installing the OS was simple with NOOBS. The USB WiFi adapter was easy to plugin and get DHCP, although getting a static IP took a lot of digging through forums to figure out and I am still not sure I completely understand what I did. But it works! Getting SSH setup was easy and made my life much easier.\n\nInstalling the camera to the pi was simple after watching an installation video. And thankfully there are easy to use programs already built for the module.\n\nGetting anything to control the vacuum was a headache. I tried first with my mac, which for whatever reason was not creating a TTY to use for communicating. Thankfully, the pi did create one. Although, when trying to use any of the npm modules built for communication, they didn't work. After digging through the specs of the iCreate 2, it turns out the baud rate is different than the original iCreate. After forking one of the modules and updating the rate, I was good to go.\n\nNext was figuring out video streaming. Lot's of people accomplished this in many different ways, but I think I found a great solution. This [project](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer) is capable of doing everything I needed. I cloned and compiled it on the pi and it already has a raspberry pi camera module interface built in! With one command, I was streaming high quality video at 30 fps.\n\nNow to find a way to use the power from the iCreate 2's serial cable to power my raspberry pi B+...\n\nI have some ideas, but since I am not an electrical engineer, I am not confident they will work. I plan on trying to use the power wires from the serial cable and using a buck converter to get a constant 5v to a micro usb cable which is plugged into the pi. Then (this is where it gets weird) I want to take the data wires (and ground I think) and splice them to a USB A cable which I can plug into the pi for communicating.\n\nNot sure if this will work, but I will find out when the parts arrive!\n\nThere is a lot more to this than I thought, but things are slowly coming together.\n\n","slug":"vacbot","index":21,"path":"/post/vacbot"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Functional Programming","blurb":"Start writing better code with these tips","layout":"post","date":"Jan 31, 2016"},"content":"\nAs I learn more about programming through the years, I find it incredible how the techniques I have come to love are normally very old.\n\nI love math.

Whether learning from past problem solving experiences, studying software patterns, or learning from other developers, my view on workflow has changed.\r\n\r\nA brief personal coding history:\r\n\r\n**High School (2007):** No OO, no tests, no code repos, no libraries. I was re-inventing the wheel wherever I went.\r\n\r\n**College:** Object oriented design, basic patterns.\r\n\r\n**First Job:** Libraries. Still developing on production code, haha...\r\n\r\n**Second Job:**  Started open source contributing. Used SVN (gross).\r\n\r\n**Current Job:** Tests. Modular design patterns. Git.\r\n\r\nThere it is, eight years of learning.\r\n\r\nI would like to share my current workflow, one that I use for almost all of my projects currently, and has served me well.\r\n\r\n### 1. State the problem or idea\r\n\r\nThis is the first and most important step. You must clearly understand your problem or idea. This is **not** the time to think about implementation! What you are doing here is defining the input and expected output. Think of use cases your solution will be solving.\r\n\r\n### 2. Design and Draw Solution\r\n\r\nYou should spend a lot of time on this one. Find a whiteboard, and get drawing. Define where the data is coming from, and where it is going. Draw how things are connected and what information will be sent between them. Think about the logic expressions you will need. If your data will need to be transformed, draw some examples. At this stage, you are writing down all your design ideas.\r\n\r\n### 3. Modularize Design\r\n\r\nBefore you start on this one, unless you are lucky enough to have two white boards, take a picture of your original solution design. During this step, you are going to simplify and modularize your solution. Start by extracting functionality into independent modules. This allows them to have a clear purpose. What you are doing in this stage is breaking down larger problems into smaller problems. This has many great side effects including easier testability, reusability, and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### 4. Create unit tests for modules\r\n\r\nLet’s make sure the modules will work as expected after we implement them. Since you have the designs for clear and independent modules now, think about the required parameters of each module and their respective required results. Now write unit tests based on your module requirements.\r\n\r\n### 5. Implement modules\r\n\r\nThis one should be straight forward. Implement modules which are validated by your units tests. You might be thinking I am a full on “Test Driven Development” dude by now. I’m not. I just picked up ideas from my peers at work and molded some of their philosophies into my development workflow. “Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.” - Bruce Lee\r\n\r\n### 6. Create use case tests\r\n\r\nNow that you have your modules created and tested, let’s write use case tests. These will be end-to-end test scenarios which cover your entire solution. They will touch many of yours modules.  That being said. I am an advocate of **really really fast tests**, so make sure you mock, stub, do whatever you need to do in order to **not** call actual outside services. That wastes time.\r\n\r\n### 7. Tie together modules to implement solution\r\n\r\nBy the time you get to this step, you should definitely know how your modules should be connected, which coding patterns you will use, and the overall structure of the codebase. Just to point out, this is **not a waterfall** workflow, be agile! If you you need to step back in the process, do it, but **follow the order** of the stages. Do not implement code before you design and write the initial tests for it. Once your use case tests pass, your solution should be complete.\r\n\r\n","slug":"workflow","index":29,"path":"/post/workflow"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"The Middleman","blurb":"Tiny server which proxies and modifies responses of another server for testing purposes","layout":"post","date":"Apr 28, 2015"},"content":"So... are you mobile friendly according to Google?\r\n\r\nI was recently working on fixing some mobile issues at my place of work.

The idea is you can analyze your codebase and score each source file with a \"bugginess\".\r\n\r\nThe problem we are trying to solve here is to mitigate the common \"Look's good to me\" when code reviewing.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why this problem exists. As any codebase and team grows, this problem grows in turn. With many developers changing source code over time, the learning curve for the codebase becomes more difficult. This problem can arise when the code reviewer does not fully understand the language, pattern, organization, structure, and history of the code.\r\n\r\nCode history holds a ton of knowledge. We humans would have a hard time holding the full history of a codebase in our head though... so let's automate it.\r\n\r\nIf we can figure out how buggy a source file is, a code reviewer can be confident in knowing how dangerous their \"Look's good to me\" comment will be. For example, if a file's bugginess score is very low, the reviewer can quickly look over the changed content and know that this file has rarely caused issues in the past. Although, on the other hand, if the file has a high score, the developer might want to ask for more developers to review the code being changed.\r\n\r\nSo how can we figure out the score of a source file?\r\n\r\nIn the original implentation, the algorithm used purely git commit messages to figure out if the files being changed were related to a bug fix. In my organization, we do not have that luxury. Our commit messages have evolved over time and we have used other tracking tools to communicate the purpose of code changes. Thankfully we have years of history in our tracking tool. And each story tied to code changes has a \"type\" we can filter by.\r\n\r\nNow we have our commits related to bug fixes.\r\n\r\nIn order to score each file, we could just count the number of commits that changed said file. Although, a Google engineer came up with a fancy formula for value-over-time which we will use instead.\r\n\r\n![t = 0..1](/hotspots-formula.gif)\r\n\r\nThe commit time is normalized by treating 0 as the first commit time and 1 as the current time. For each commit, this score is added to the changed file's total score.\r\n\r\nAs for the implentation, I used local git commands instead of hitting Github's API for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Speed of commit searching and information retrieval\r\n- Did not want users to have to hassle with another API token\r\n\r\nAfter building the data, I sort it and output the result to a CSV file for ease of visualization.\r\n\r\nI simply dragged it into Google Drive and created a chart in seconds, which showed where our dangerous code lived.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [code](https://github.com/dijs/hotspots)!\r\n\r\n### Future Ideas\r\n\r\n- Integrate more tracking tools\r\n- Use Github Issues as a source of data\r\n- Allow for custom value-of-time formulas\r\n- Modularize the commit gathering (choose local git, github, bitbucket)\r\n","slug":"hotspots","index":31,"path":"/post/hotspots"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Mutation Testing in Javascript","blurb":"Automatically find bugs in your unit tests by slightly mutating your source code","layout":"post","date":"Mar 1, 2015"},"content":"\r\nMutation testing is hard... But totally worth it!\r\n\r\nI recently learned about the concept from a colleague. For those who might not know what it is:\r\n\r\nTesting by mutation calculates the durability of your unit tests against mutated versions of your source code. These mutant versions are designed to be the result of common programming errors. Since there are many different types of errors, this means that normally a large number of mutants are created and tested. These mutants would be extremely difficult to create by hand, so mutants are generally automatically generated from changing the source code using common *error* patterns.\r\n\r\nError pattern examples may include switching conditional, logical, and arithmetic operators. Possibly even changing the value of literals within the code. These are just a few ideas, and I am hoping one day we can have a more *standardized* set of patterns to use.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nA (hopefully obvious) perquisite to mutation testing is that your unit tests need to **pass** against your original source code. Also, the faster your unit tests are, the easier mutation testing will be.\r\n\r\nSo, step by step:\r\n\r\n1. A baseline unit test is run against your original source code\r\n2. Mutated versions of your code (**mutants**) are generated by changing the code slightly\r\n3. Each mutant is ran against the same unit tests\r\n4. If a mutant passes the test suite, it is considered **killed**\r\n5. Your **score** is calculated by how many mutants were killed against how many were created\r\n\r\nThe goal is to try to kill all the mutants.\r\n\r\n### By example...\r\n\r\nHere we have a very simple Javascript module:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//Bank Account Module\r\nmodule.exports = function() {\r\n\tvar balance = 0;\r\n\tthis.getBalance = function() {\r\n\t\treturn balance;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.deposit = function(amount) {\r\n\t\tbalance += amount;\r\n\t};\r\n\tthis.withdraw = function(amount) {\r\n\t\tif (balance \u003e= amount) {\r\n\t\t\tbalance -= amount;\r\n\t\t\treturn true;\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n\treturn this;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nEasy mutation could be to change the balance literal to initialize to -1.\r\n\r\nIf our unit tests started each check with a clean Account instance and assumed that the balance should be 0, our tests would fail.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//Unit Test (Wrong)\r\nit('should deposit', function() {\r\n\taccount.deposit(50);\r\n\taccount.getBalance().should.equal(50);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe corrected unit test might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//Unit Test (Corrected)\r\nit('should deposit', function() {\r\n\tvar initial = account.getBalance();\r\n\taccount.deposit(50);\r\n\taccount.getBalance().should.equal(initial + 50);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is **one** example where mutation testing could help.\r\n\r\n### So I created something\r\n\r\nIn order to better understand and learn about mutation testing, I wanted to write my own Javascript mutation tester. I found one project for mutation testing in Javascript, and although I am normally a fan of \"don't re-invent the wheel\". In this case, the tool was only usable for *grunt* built projects. I wanted to create a more general use tool which was (build system) agnostic.\r\n\r\nBig hurdle I hit with writing this was actually \"node-specifc\" issues. While mutating source code, loading and running tests, I kept getting the same results. After hours of beating my head against the wall, I tried renaming the files before loading them in. Sure enough, it worked. So in doing this project I learned a bit more about how the node.js **require** method works and how it caches files.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/dijs/profx) is the project.\r\n","slug":"mutation-testing-in-javascript","index":32,"path":"/post/mutation-testing-in-javascript"},{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Parsz","blurb":"Parse HTML with a JSON based structure request","layout":"post","date":"Jan 25, 2015"},"content":"I have been always been entranced with how much data is publicly available on the web. Although, most of the time the data is not directly usable for other purposes than reading. With so many HTML parsing libraries out there, it is common practice to build an application for a particular site and a specific data set. Parsz tries to generalize the \"parsing\" and focus on the data structure you need. Instead of downloading, processing, and transforming the data each time you need to parse a web page, use parsz. Enough of the TV commercial...\r\n\r\nI did NOT originally think of this. [This guy](https://github.com/fizx/parsley/) did. I saw it, thought it was a great idea and decided such a simple idea could be implemented much easier by using Node.\r\n\r\nThe idea that caught me was to not re-implement the same dang code over and over again (possibly with stupid mistakes) in order to preform data parsing on a web page. Looking back, it makes me feel stupid. HTML has for the most part, been standardized. Why did I never think to build a engine which would use data/element or data/attribute relationships to build a recipe for parsing needed data. I really like the notion of labeling the data by name and location and having \"someone\" else do the work.\r\n\r\nSince JSON has become very popular, I have not built in XML based output yet, although that may be just a npm module away.\r\n\r\nThere are many improvements and features to add, like regular expression support and custom functions.

Personally, I am not good at choosing which way to visualize this data, but once seen, I understand the value of them. We recently acquired a project manager for the team. He spent time creating charts of our sprint progress by hand, almost every day. While these charts were very useful and telling, my engineering brain could not let go of the fact that we should be able to see this, anytime, with any teams data. So I made it.\r\n\r\nI have started with only one graph. But I believe it is a important graph to have. It shows the progress of sprint stories over time. Our developers use it on a daily basis, during our stand ups. The project managers have been the key user of this project and have been very helpful. They can instantly find ways to make it more useful for them and the team.\r\n\r\nEnough backstory, lets talk code.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nWe use [Pivotal](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) here to track our stories (bugs, chores, features...) and they have a pretty decent API. I had used their API on many other occasions creating internal apps for our team. But this project seemed to be begging to be open source. I generalized the data gathering and processing as much as I could. The filters in the app itself should work for any team. I stuck to a node app for ease of development, since I had already written a module for the Pivotal API. I got lots of practice with the use of [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) chaining for data processing. By finding the ways to filter/map/group your data, you can truly make your code pretty and easy to understand. The difficult part was actually transforming the data to work with the chart [library](http://nvd3.org/). By the way, if anyone can see a better way to transform the data, please let me know! The charting library I used was a powerful tool, but hard to find documentation for.

Downside was the mobile app. It was expensive and did not features I had seen on some other free flashcard apps.\r\n\r\nA friend drew my attention to [Flashcards](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flashcards/id478986342?mt=8) by NKO, which was a very fun app to use and it was free!\r\n\r\nI wanted to use this new app for my mobile studying, but there was no way I was going to manually create hundreds of words...on my phone...\r\n\r\nAfter doing a little research into the different applications deck file formats, I felt like hacking. Turned out that both apps just used compressed zip files as their outer shell and renamed the extensions. Anki used a complicated SQLite database to store all of their information for each deck. I quickly was able to export the needed data rows (English and Hungarian columns) to a CSV file. The other app used a FDK file format, which archived a JSON (YAY!) configuration file and data files (Images and Sounds). This format was a bit harder to build.\r\n\r\nMy first run through was simple, I just created a text-only version of my Anki deck. Worked like a champ!\r\n\r\nNext big idea was to add images. Ugh... I had a list of English words, and I needed relevant images to pair them with. First tried with Google... Nope, they cut you off quickly with their API limits. After a few more tries, Flickr turned out to be the best, and the easiest to use. Now I had the images and the word pair data.\r\n\r\nGenerating the JSON configuration file took a while to figure out. Turned out they only allow you to use a max of 100 card decks in the free version of the app. I modified my conversion app to iterate through each word pair and link the images.\r\n\r\nEnd result was awesome. Tons of pretty cards to flip through. Now to practice...\r\n\r\nI was planning on released the source code of this project, was it became VERY domain specific.

So, I decided to create books of all my articles per year.

After memorizing a bunch of words, just repeating them to study got boring. I wanted to write a program which randomly created sentences I could use to practice with. Of course, the best practice would be to go find a native speaker near me, but I wanted a challenge...\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nIn order to generate random sentences, I needed some kind of sentence building logic. I have used Markov Chains to build random names in the past, so why would it not work for sentences?\n\n### Data\n\nFirst! I needed data. Thank God for \u003chttp://www.gutenberg.org/\u003e. This saved me loads of time finding a bunch of random text.\n\n### Training\n\nThis was a lot of data, so I did not want to load it all in memory at once. Let's use Stream's!\n\nI streamed the huge text data file and counted all the instances of each [bigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) and [trigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram). After counting, I sorted each word's adjacent neighbor by the number of instances. This gave me a list of words and their most used adajcent bigram and trigram neighbor.\n\n### Generation\n\nWith this Markov \"link\" data, I was able to generate rudimentary sentences. Nothing made sense, but it was easy to read.\n\nThese sentences are not logical, they are built by choosing what word should statistically come next.\n\n### Ideas for the future:\n\n- Extract/Analyze subject, verb, object in each sentence\n- Use neural networks for training _next_ word\n\n### Code\n\n```js\n//Create Markov links\nfunction createLinks(input, output, n) {\n\tvar links = {};\n\n\tif (!n) {\n\t\tn = 2; // bigram by default\n\t}\n\n\tfunction trainSentence(sentence) {\n\t\tNGrams.ngrams(sentence, n).forEach(function(gram) {\n\t\t\tvar word = gram[0];\n\t\t\tvar neighbor = gram[n - 1];\n\t\t\tif (!links[word]) {\n\t\t\t\tlinks[word] = {};\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (!links[word][neighbor]) {\n\t\t\t\tlinks[word][neighbor] = 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tlinks[word][neighbor]++;\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\tfunction read() {\n\t\tvar buffer;\n\t\twhile ((buffer = stream.read())) {\n\t\t\tbuffer\n\t\t\t\t.toLowerCase()\n\t\t\t\t.split(/\\./g)\n\t\t\t\t.forEach(trainSentence);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvar stream = fs.createReadStream(input, {\n\t\tencoding: 'utf8'\n\t});\n\n\tstream.on('readable', read);\n\n\tstream.once('end', function() {\n\t\tvar sortedLinks = {};\n\t\tvar keys = Object.keys(links);\n\n\t\tkeys.forEach(function(key) {\n\t\t\tvar words = Object.keys(links[key]);\n\t\t\tsortedLinks[key] = _.sortBy(words, function(word) {\n\t\t\t\treturn links[key][word];\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tfs.writeFile(output, JSON.stringify(sortedLinks, null, '\\t'));\n\t});\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n//Generate Sentence\nfunction generateSentenceMark2(\n\tbigramInput,\n\ttrigramInput,\n\tlength,\n\tk,\n\tdictionary,\n\tstarter\n) {\n\tvar bigrams = require(bigramInput);\n\tvar trigrams = require(trigramInput);\n\n\tvar current = starter || _.sample(dictionary || Object.keys(bigrams));\n\tvar last;\n\n\tvar sentence = [current];\n\n\tfunction dictionaryContains(word) {\n\t\treturn _.contains(dictionary, word);\n\t}\n\n\tfunction getNeighbor(links, word) {\n\t\tvar neighbors = links[word];\n\t\tif (dictionary) {\n\t\t\tneighbors = neighbors.filter(dictionaryContains);\n\t\t}\n\t\t// neighbors might be null or empty...\n\t\tvar neighbor = neighbors[Math.ceil(neighbors.length * Math.random() * k)];\n\t\t// Go through all of the words if word doesnt have neighbors\n\t\tvar i = 0;\n\t\twhile (!_.has(links, neighbor) \u0026\u0026 i \u003c neighbors.length) {\n\t\t\tneighbor = neighbors[i++];\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn neighbor;\n\t}\n\n\t// Generate Neighbors\n\t_(length - 1).times(function(i) {\n\t\tvar neighbor =\n\t\t\ti % 2 === 0 ? getNeighbor(bigrams, current) : getNeighbor(trigrams, last);\n\t\tlast = current;\n\t\tcurrent = neighbor;\n\t\tsentence.push(current);\n\t});\n\n\treturn sentence.join(' ');\n}\n```\n","slug":"random-sentences","index":38,"path":"/post/random-sentences"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"jHfeSWgfKaRFvnciPc1iL","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
